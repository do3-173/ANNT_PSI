## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:
- Knight's Tour
- Isolation Knight Game

## Knight's Tour

The Knight's Tour is a classic computer science problem where the objective is to move a knight on a chessboard such that it visits every square exactly once. This implementation uses the Warnsdorff's heuristic for the solution.

## Isolation Knight Game

The Isolation Knight Game is a two-player strategy game where players control knights on an 8x8 chessboard. The objective is to move the knight in a way that leaves the opponent with no valid moves. Once a square is visited, it cannot be revisited. The player with the immobile knight loses.
